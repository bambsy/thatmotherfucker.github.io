<p>
Melt butter on low heat in medium saucepan
</p>
<p>
Mix ground buds into melted butter a bit at a time, stir in between
</p>
<p>
Simmer on low heat for 45 mins, stir frequently
<br>You should start to see tiny bubbles forming on surface, the smell means its working!
</p>
<p>
Strain butter with metal strainer into resealable container, this way you don't have ground bud in the final product
</p>
  </section>
<p>
Use spoon to squeeze all cannabutter from ground bud in metal strainer
</p>
<p>
Most prefer to put their cannabutter into the fridge so it forms a more solid block. Depending on your recipe and when you plan to make it, this step is optional. Your cannabutter should look green and smell different from regular butter, but depending on the butter you use, it may have more of a green tint to it.
